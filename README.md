# supercollider

Supercollider projects and experiments.

Requires https://github.com/supercollider/sc3-plugins, follow install instructions there.

Running some files might require some classes I've made. To run them yourself, you can copy `extensions.sc` into your user extensions dir `Platform.userExtensionDir;`, then recompile the class library.
